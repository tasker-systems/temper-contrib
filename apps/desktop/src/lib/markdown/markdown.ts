// Ported from temper's temper-ui (tasker-systems/temper, packages/temper-ui/src/lib/markdown.ts, at
// 5344abc) by copy-with-citation, per the desktop's rendering-baseline design (ruling 2):
// temper-ui is not a package and contrib ships no temper code. Any desktop adaptation is marked
// "Desktop:"; everything else is the baseline as it stands.
//
// markdown.ts — the one Marked instance, with fenced-block syntax highlighting, and the one
// markdown→HTML preparation.
//
// An isolated `Marked` instance rather than `marked.use()` on the module singleton: a global
// mutation would silently reconfigure every other consumer of the package, and the instance
// makes the highlighting pipeline unit-testable without a component or a DOM.
//
// highlight.js over Shiki here because the pipeline is synchronous end to end — `parse` feeds
// the sanitizer pass in `MarkdownRenderer`, and an async highlighter would force that whole
// chain to restructure for prettier output. Language registration and the
// unknown-language-means-plaintext rule live in `highlight.ts`, shared with the direct-code
// JSON viewers (`ArtifactList` content, `ShapeList` schema).
//
// This module is DOM-FREE, deliberately, so it is servable in both environments. Sanitization
// is client-only: DOMPurify's server-side story requires a DOM emulation stack (jsdom) whose
// transitive tree does not load on every serverless runtime, and a security gate must not be
// runtime-sensitive. `MarkdownRenderer` gates the {@html} on the client-loaded sanitizer
// (`$lib/sanitize` owns the pass and its config) and never falls back to unsanitized output —
// which is why `prepareMarkdown` may return parse output that only the sanitizer may render.
