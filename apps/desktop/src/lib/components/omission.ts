/**
 * The omission sentence every bounded view ends with, composed from its numbers so no author words

 * what lies either side: `more` is the answer's own word that rows follow, never a guess from how
 * many rows arrived.
 *
 * A graph view composes its omissions in the read's own terms: a walk says how deep it went and
 * that deeper was not reported — there is no denominator to count, and none is invented; an entry
 * read says drawn of eligible and how many in-scope nodes it did not draw for having no
 * connections; a cut to the drawing's bounds is counted, never silent.
